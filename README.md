Mail Application with Java



This is the first desktop app I've made. A simple application that I developed to show my Java knowledge in the 1st Year of University (2019). Although it is not very appealing in appearance, I was able to perform file operations without any problems. For example, I performed classical operations such as adding, deleting, updating, checking, etc.
When a person who wants to set up an account registers from the registration field, 2 files are created. the first is userName-send.txt , the second is userName-take.txt. These files store the emails that the user sends and receives.
